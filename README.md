better-cash.c | This code calculates the number of each denomination of bills (1000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, and 1 pesos) needed to represent a given cash amount, and then prints the results. 
bubble-my.c | Sort an array using bubble sort algorithm.
cash.c | Calculate the number of each denomination, but uses while loop.
dynamic-array.c | This program dynamically allocates memory for an array based on user input, stores user-provided integers in that array, prints the entered values, and then frees the allocated memory. 
exercise5-3.c | This program takes two numerical lists that end with a sentinel value, stores them in arrays X and Y (each with a maximum of 20 elements), calculates the product of corresponding elements into array Z, sums the elements of Z, and then prints the square root of this sum. It handles dynamic input lengths using the sentinel value to signify the end of input.
exercise5-4.c | A program that would store 11 numbers in a one dimensional array. Store the sum of the two succeeding pairs in another array. Hence, only 10 integers will be stored in the second array.
exercise5-5.c | A program that accepts as input student name and the set of their test answers as one dimensional array. The program should grade the test. If the student choice is 1 give 1 point. If the choice is 2, give 2 points. 3 points if choice answer is 3 and 4 pints for answer 4 and choice 5 is 5 points. Otherwise no point is given to other choices. Print out the average score of the student in the test.
